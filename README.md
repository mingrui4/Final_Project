Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

TEMPLATE for your report:

# Title: Four-in-row game

## Team Member(s): 
Songwei Feng, Jinlin Zeng, Mingrui Yin, Ni Lin

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
Run main.py, then there will be a board shows in the run window, choose which one to move the stone first, the player or AI. For the player, input a tuple like (1,1) to put the stone. Then move the stone one by one. When someone has four stones in a row, then the player will be the winner. If there is no place to put a new stone, the game will be draw.
